# simpleWebChatApplication
simple chatting application (stateless/temporary )

> Deployed Here : [Go to the site to test](https://kurakani1.herokuapp.com/)

Its a simple group chat application which has a special feature of not storing any message history maintaining the anonymity 
among the people chatting in the group.

Current state of the application:

Single Common chat room where people join, set their nickname and then start talking.
This application was build during the learning phase but its got a lot of potential. Many ideas will be implemented hopefully
in the near future to make this app great for chatting among small groups :_.

> The messages is not stored on the server. Thus all the past messages is gone once user refreshes the browser. Its good for
anonymous chatting where u dont want the history to persist.

The site is already deployed. You can go
