			<h3>About This Application</h3>
			<p>This is an simple group chat application where no logs of the information are stored in server or database hence stateless. All the chat information stays only until browser refreshes and thus chat history cannot be accessed on later state. </p>
			<p>This application can be used for group discussion about things which donot matter later (no need to see the history later ) and hence can be used for anonymous chatting (self destructable)</p>
			<p>You have to use a nickname initially to start group chatting</p>
			<p><strong> || NOTE || :</strong> No data is stored in the server. So all data is lost after you refresh your browser :).No server side caching no client side caching as well :)</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>New Updates And Added Features</h3>
			<p>There is a public room where you can join and chat with people. Anyone can join the public server.</p>
			<p>If you want to talk with specific group of people then you can go to private room section where u can create a private room and set password for the room. Only the users who know the room name and password can enter the room and talk.</p>
